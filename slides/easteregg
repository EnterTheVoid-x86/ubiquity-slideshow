hi, my name is sean.

congrats on somehow finding this easter egg,
good for you

ubiquity took quite a bit to set up especially with all of the html files, and so i'm gonna document the process

using a simple bash for loop, i replaced most of the mentions of ubuntu with esterOS, and then i manually edited the htmls with nvim.

i wanna die.
